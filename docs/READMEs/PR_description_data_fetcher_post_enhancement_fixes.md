# Pull Request: Data Fetcher Post-Enhancement Fixes

**Branch**: `fix/data-fetcher-post-enhancement-fixes`  
**Author**: Neil Watson (`@NwtsN`)  
**Date**: 15 June 2025

## 📌 Overview

This pull request includes a wide range of **enhancements, refactors, and fixes** made to the **data fetcher** and **data inserter** components of the factor investing system. These changes aim to improve modularity, ensure more robust database integration, simplify staging cache management, clarify the codebase structure, and enhance documentation for maintainability and onboarding.

---

## 🔧 Key Changes

### ✅ Documentation & Examples
- Enhanced `main.py` to include:
  - Proper **data inserter integration example**
  - Implementation template for staging cache clearing after data insertion
- Updated `README.md`:
  - Renamed `insert_data.py` to `fetch_data.py` to reflect actual functionality
  - Added new API documentation for **staging cache management**
  - Introduced **time-based auto-cleanup strategy** documentation

---

### 🧹 Refactors & Improvements

#### Staging Cache Management
- **Simplified cache cleanup logic** using time-based intervals (5 minutes)
- Removed mod-10 based triggering for better clarity and consistency
- Eliminated unnecessary threading logic

#### Code Quality & Naming
- Renamed `insert_data.py` ➝ `fetch_data.py` to align with its actual responsibilities
- Moved **data inserter logic** to a standalone module for better modularity
- Cleaned up date parsing in `_get_last_fetch_info`

---

### 🛠️ Schema Changes & Database Enhancements

#### `fundamental_data` Table:
- Added:
  - `fiscal_date_ending`
  - `ratio_calculation_timestamp`
- Removed:
  - `date NOT NULL` constraint (too ambiguous)

#### New Tables Introduced:
- `extracted_fundamental_data`: stores cleaned API data for CROCI and ETR calculations
- `eps_data`: stores last five EPS reports separately
- Better indexing and ticker symbol added to `raw_api_responses` for performance

#### Schema Consistency Fixes:
- Added missing fields (e.g. effective tax rate and long-term investments) to accommodate CROCI logic
- Removed confusing unused tables to streamline the data pipeline

---

### ✨ New Features

- Added **Effective Tax Rate (ETR) calculation** logic, including edge case handling for:
  - Tax benefits on positive earnings
  - Positive tax on losses
  - Sensible defaults when signs differ
- Introduced a **first working prototype** of the `data_inserter`

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Manual testing of:
  - Integration with `main.py`
  - Staging cache automatic cleanup over time
  - Data insertion correctness and table population
- No regressions observed in API response handling or CROCI-related computations

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

- `signal`-based timeouts and UNIX-specific logic still need Windows support
- Partial data insertions not yet rollback-safe (transactional integrity should be improved in future)
- Data cleanup relies on system clock — ensure consistent environment time settings

---

## 🔁 Follow-Ups & Next Steps

- Introduce **unit tests** for `data_inserter` and `fetch_data.py`
- Implement **transaction safety** and **rollback logic** for insertions
- Enhance **cross-platform timeout** mechanisms
- Add retry-with-backoff for failed API fetches
