# Database Handler Improvements, Security Fixes, and Major Refactoring

## Summary

This PR introduces significant improvements to the database handling system, addressing security vulnerabilities, enhancing error handling, and implementing a more robust data pipeline. The changes include a complete refactoring of the financial data processing with TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) metrics, proper transaction management, and comprehensive documentation updates.

## Key Changes

### üîí Security Improvements

- **API Key Protection**: Removed API key exposure from error messages and logs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Added ticker symbol validation with length limits (max 10 characters)
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Prevented response data from being logged in fetch_data.py
- **Validation Enhancements**: Added comprehensive input validation for API keys (rejecting empty/demo keys)

### üèóÔ∏è Major Architecture Changes

#### Database Connection Management
- **Breaking Change**: DataInserter now accepts existing SQLite connections to prevent locking issues
- **Context Manager Support**: DataManager now implements `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for proper resource cleanup
- **Transaction Modes**: Added support for two transaction strategies:
  - `all-or-nothing`: Single transaction for all operations (default)
  - `individual`: Separate transactions per operation

#### Financial Data Pipeline Refactoring
- **TTM Metrics**: Added trailing twelve months calculations for flow metrics
- **EPS Data Structure**: Fixed to include fiscal dates with values
  - **Breaking**: `eps_last_5_qs` now returns `[{fiscalDateEnding, reportedEPS, eps_value}]` instead of `[float]`
- **Fiscal Date Extraction**: Now extracts actual dates from reports instead of using fetch timestamps
- **Schema Expansion**: Database now includes TTM, quarterly, and annual columns

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Critical Fixes
- Fixed `db.db_path ‚Üí db.db_name` AttributeError in main.py
- Resolved SQLite compatibility issues (replaced TRUE/FALSE with 1/0)
- Fixed cursor management to prevent concurrent operation issues
- Corrected variable scope in `extract_eps_list`
- Fixed None handling in fiscal dates
- Resolved logger attempting to write after database connection closed

#### Data Processing Fixes
- Fixed minimum valid fields count after fundamental data fetch updates
- Renamed `api_name` to `endpoint_key` throughout codebase for clarity
- Fixed database query to check last successful fetch of all 4 endpoints
- Eliminated redundant EPS data extraction in insertion process

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout and Safety Features

- **CLI Support**: Added `--timeout` option for runtime limits
- **Safety Checks**: Implemented `check_timeout_safety()` to prevent mid-operation timeouts
- **Staging Cache**: 24-hour cache with automatic cleanup every 5 minutes
- **Graceful Handling**: Staging cache preserved on timeout for retry capability
- **Exit Codes**: Changed timeout exit code from 0 to 124 (standard timeout code)

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Enhancements

- Fixed bare except clauses with proper error types
- Added missing error propagation in schema execution
- Improved config file error handling with specific exceptions (FileNotFoundError, YAMLError)
- Added helpful hints for common configuration issues
- Enhanced transaction rollback with original error preservation
- Added race condition handling for concurrent stock record creation

### üìö Documentation Updates

- Updated main README with timeout functionality and CLI options
- Added transaction mode documentation with examples
- Documented 24-hour staging cache with automatic cleanup
- Updated architecture section with current components
- Enhanced database module README with context manager usage examples
- Fixed CROCI calculation bias documentation (downwards, not upwards)
- Added troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Usage Examples

### New Context Manager Pattern
```python
# Old way (no longer recommended)
data_manager = DataManager(conn, logger)

# New way (ensures proper cleanup)
with DataManager(conn, logger) as data_manager:
    # Your operations here
    pass
```

### Transaction Mode Selection
```bash
# Use single transaction for better performance
python main.py --transaction-mode all-or-nothing

# Use individual transactions for granular error handling
python main.py --transaction-mode individual
```

### Timeout Configuration
```bash
# Set 30-minute timeout
python main.py --timeout 1800
```

## Breaking Changes

1. **DataManager Context Manager**: Must now be used with `with` statement
2. **EPS Data Structure**: Returns dictionaries with dates instead of raw floats
3. **DataInserter Connection**: Now requires existing database connection

## Migration Guide

### For DataManager Users
```python
# Before
data_manager = DataManager(conn, logger)
data_manager.process_data()

# After
with DataManager(conn, logger) as data_manager:
    data_manager.process_data()
```

### For EPS Data Consumers
```python
# Before
eps_values = data['eps_last_5_qs']  # [1.23, 4.56, 7.89]

# After
eps_data = data['eps_last_5_qs']
# [
#   {'fiscalDateEnding': '2024-03-31', 'reportedEPS': '1.23', 'eps_value': 1.23},
#   {'fiscalDateEnding': '2023-12-31', 'reportedEPS': '4.56', 'eps_value': 4.56}
# ]
eps_values = [item['eps_value'] for item in eps_data]
```

## Performance Improvements

- Single transaction mode significantly improves bulk insert performance
- Reduced redundant data processing in EPS extraction
- Automatic cleanup of expired staging data reduces memory footprint
- Parallel processing capabilities with proper connection handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**: Verify API keys are not exposed in logs
2. **Transaction Testing**: Test both transaction modes with large datasets
3. **Timeout Testing**: Verify graceful handling at various timeout thresholds
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid tickers, network failures, and database locks
5. **Migration Testing**: Ensure existing code can be updated to new patterns

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding retry logic for transient database errors
- Explore connection pooling for improved performance
- Add metrics collection for monitoring insertion performance
- Consider implementing a more sophisticated caching strategy
